## Purpose:

Chess game that lets two players play chess again each other

## Description:

This game displays a graphical representation of a chess game in the console using Unicode characters. Players take turns to move their chess pieces in standard notation (i.e. b3 to c4). Basic chess rules have been incorporated.

## Background:

This program was an assignment of the course COMPGC01 - Introduction to Programming - at University College London. It was created in my second week of coding, so please don't be so hard on me ;D
